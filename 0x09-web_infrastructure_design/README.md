## Project Details

### 1. Simple Web Stack
   - Basic web infrastructure suitable for small-scale projects.
   - Components: Single server, LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl).

### 2. Distributed Web Infrastructure
   - Web infrastructure designed for scalability and fault tolerance.
   - Components: Load balancer, multiple web servers, application servers, and a database cluster.

### 3. Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
   - Emphasis on security and real-time monitoring for enhanced reliability.
   - Components: Firewalls, SSL certificate for HTTPS, monitoring clients (e.g., Sumo Logic Data Collectors).

### 4. Scaled-Up Web Infrastructure
   - Infrastructure designed to handle increased traffic and ensure optimal performance.
   - Components: Load balancer, multiple web servers, scalable application servers, and a distributed database system.

Each design provides specific details and considerations tailored to its intended use.
