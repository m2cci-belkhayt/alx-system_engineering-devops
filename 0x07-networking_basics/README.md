# Networking Basics - OSI Model Overview

## Project Description

In this project, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of networking basics, specifically focusing on the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. The OSI model is an abstract framework that elucidates the layered design of communication and computer networks. The primary goal is to delineate and organize the various components that facilitate communication.

## Learning Objectives

By engaging with this project, you will:

- Grasp the essence of the OSI model.
- Discern the number of layers within the OSI model.
- Comprehend the organizational structure of the OSI model.

### [0. OSI Model](./0-OSI_model)

Explore the OSI model, an abstract representation designed to articulate the layered structure of communication and computer network design.

### [1. Types of Network](./1-types_of_network)

Learn about the different types of networks and their distinct characteristics.

### [2. MAC and IP Address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address)

Delve into the concepts of MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses.

### [3. UDP and TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP)

Gain insights into UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and their roles in network communication.

### [4. TCP and UDP Ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)

Understand the significance of TCP and UDP ports in directing packets to the correct network device.

### [5. Is the Host on the Network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network)

Explore methods for determining whether a host is present on the network.
