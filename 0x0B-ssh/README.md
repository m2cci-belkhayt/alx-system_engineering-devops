# Server Configuration and SSH Key Authentication

This project focuses on connecting to an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server using SSH key authentication. The objective is to understand the basics of servers, SSH, and creating and using SSH RSA key pairs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

- What is a server?
- Where servers usually live.
- What is SSH?
- How to create an SSH RSA key pair.
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair.
- The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`.

## Resources

Before starting the tasks, it is recommended to read or watch the provided resources to gain a better understanding:

- [What is a (physical) server - text](link-to-text-resource)
- [What is a (physical) server - video](link-to-video-resource)
- [SSH essentials](link-to-ssh-essentials)
- [SSH Config File](link-to-ssh-config)
- [Public Key Authentication for SSH](link-to-public-key-auth)
- [How Secure Shell Works](link-to-ssh-works)
- [SSH Crash Course](link-to-ssh-crash-course) (Long, but highly informative. Watch this if configuring SSH is still confusing. It may be helpful to watch at x1.25 speed or above.)
